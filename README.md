Visualize a tolerance relation (based on spring forces)

Previously we generated tolerance relations from the distance of objects.
Here the situation is reversed: from any tolerance relation we generate a 2D representation
in a such a way that the nodes of similar objects are close, while the nodes of different object are far from each other.
This placement is inspired by physics, and the location of the objects changes dynamically with the changes of the relation.
As each undirected graph could be treated as a tolerance relation, results can be used widely.
